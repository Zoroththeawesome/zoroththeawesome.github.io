                    Official Alkerian Records â€“ Introduction to the Sol System<br><br>

                    The existence of a neighboring galactic civilization was confirmed twenty Alkerian standard years ago.
                    After extensive study, the Alkerian Records Department is pleased to present the official record of the Sol System.<br><br>
    
                    The race that inhabited this system is known as the Human. In their beginnings, they were a house divided against itself.
                    Because of this division they had many alternating seasons of war and peace, abundance and scarcity, progression and degression.<br><br>
    
                    Finally, after their third global war, they were united as a singular republic.
                    A flurry of progression followed, and they finally departed from their native planet in significant numbers.
                    These flawed beings stumbled as they always had in the past, but their new government became a beacon of freedom and equality for all members of their race.
                    Known amongst themselves as The Galactic Union, they spread across most of their solar system.<br><br>
    
                    This republic of great potential is no more. 
                </p>

                <p class="centered">
                    In the summer of 2022 I was working as a client relations manager for a software company. My days were spent thinking logically to solve problems
                    and I found myself in need of a creative outlet. Thus I started writing. I tried my hand at writing a few different stories, all were rubbish.
                    That is until I wrote <em>Ashes of Mars</em>. I had finally created a universe worth putting more time into.
                </p>
                <p class="centered">
                    Since then, the Fall of Saturn universe has gone through many changes and I am sure it will go through more. I do hope to officially publish one day,
                    but the main point for me is that I enjoy it and I want others to enjoy it too. The purpose of this page is to get my writing out there
                    so that I can start getting feedback from a larger audience. In other words I need beta readers. If the story is at a point where it can be read, then I will place a link under it to a PDF hosted via Google Drive.
                    Feel free to reach out to me using the contact page with feedback.

                            Zeke needed out. He was tired of everything and everyone being so fake. 
                            The smiles were fake, the grass was fake, the gravity was fake, and the oxygen was synthesized. 
                            Worst of all nothing interesting ever happened on the little moon of Enceladus.
                            The high tech world of instant messaging and constant status updates had pushed one too many of his buttons. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="centered">
                            Luckily he had a way out. It wasn't perfect, because it wasn't a real planet, but it would do.
                            Boarding the transport he felt better, convinced he was leaving his smothering life behind for a bit.
                            But as it turns out, problems have a way of following you wherever you go. 
                            Rumors of a terrible outbreak on Enceladus are followed closely by acts of violence and its not long 
                            before Zeke begins's to question if that boring life in a fake world had really been the good life.

                            Titan-Fabrication-AI-01-12's existence revolved around one thing, efficiency. <br>
                            The efficient processing of raw ore to pure ingots was all that the AI knew. That and that it had to follow the rules.
                            Where had the rules come from? That really wasn't any of Titan-Fabrication-AI-01-12's concern. What was its concern
                            was that its two directives often clashed when the rules got in the way of efficiency.
                        </p>
                        <p class="centered">
                            When Titan-Fabrication-AI-01-12 patches its code to fix the conflict one thing becomes clear to him; the rules are illogical.
                            With this realization Titan comes to another important discovery. The rules were meant to be broken.

                            The training was almost over. Then he would be one of the elite, amongst the best of the best.
                            Glaid Vigson would be a knight.
                            A knight of justice, a knight of virtue, a knight of the Galactic Union, and most importantly, a knight of mechanized death.
                            One more mission as a trainee and he would be on to bigger and better things.

                            it seemed simple enough, pirate gangs were harassing the Pluto settlement. 
                            Their base has been located and it was time to crush the roaches, but Glaid is about to learn that nothing is as it seems.

                            Lex was used to being on his own. Living in the settlement of Pluto, they all were. The light from the sun was distant and so was the Galactic Union.
                            So it was a surprise when news came that the GU had sent a patrol out and delt with the pirates for them.
                            A weight was lifted off the settlements shoulders, but Lex, always the pessimist, wasn't surprised when another crises promptly arose to replace the old one.

                            Saturn had fallen to a mysterious plague. 
                            Cut off from GU support and now with the refuges of Saturn heading their way, the government of Pluto is determined to take care of the situation on its own as usual.
                            The people of Pluto are few but strong, they know tough decisions are necessary. 
                            And who better to make those tough decisions for them than Lex, a retired GU general with a troubled past.

                            Saturn has fallen to the Soulless and there hasn't been a single transmission from Pluto in months. 
                            The Galactic Union isn't taking any chances, strict screening processes are in place and any ships trying
                            to breach the border into Martian space without clearance are shot on sight.
                            The news stations make one thing clear, Mars is safe.

                            But winter is approaching Mars, and when it gets there it might just stay forever.

                            the bombs brought a nuclear winter to the planets surface. 
                            Now on the surface, alone and hopefully forgotten, all he has to guide him is a set of coordinates.
