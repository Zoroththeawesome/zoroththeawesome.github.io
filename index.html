            <h1 class="centered">Welcome to my website!</h1>
            <p class="centered">
                Welcome, please be aware this website serves a few different purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
                If your not an employer you're here to view something that I made for fun and wanted to share with you. Head over to the Projects/Hobbies tab and choose the appropriate drop down. Enjoy!
            </p>
            <p>
                Firstly this is a place for me to experiment and practice my coding.
                For example if you were to inspect this website you would find this particular page is coded just using plain HTML and CSS. Other pages though take advantage of
                things like Bootstrap to handle the formatting and to add in icons and pictures easier. 
                Because this is a place to experiment some pages are unfinished and instead of taking away the tab I left them attached. 
                This is also why the drop downs are a little.. different. I experimented and wrote the code myself without looking up more established methods of doing it. I have considered updating it but just haven't.
                In short this website is my sandbox.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next this website serves as my portfolio. I have discovered that most hiring managers never take the time to view these, but never the less this website is linked into my
                electronic resume. This is likely the only way employers will find this website as I have purposely avoided using my real name in the domain name.
                Why would I do this you ask? simple; I enjoy my privacy. As far as employment goes this website is only for serious prospective employers who are trying to get a feel of who I am and what skills I have.
                My thought process here is that a seriously interested employer would have paid attention and clicked on the link when they went over my resume.
                To that end I felt the honesty and openness of half finished pages was appropriate as this is how I like to govern my interactions with others.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are a prospective employer I would direct your attention to the "Skills Demo" tab. 
                The Resume page just opens up a PDF of my resume and the Education Tracker tab is still under development. 
                Back in 2022 I made some video demonstrations as part of a boot camp I took. 
                The goal of the videos was to demonstrate how quickly I am able to learn with little training and the things I had managed to learn. 
                I recommend these videos specifically because they directly demonstrate skills such as Python, SQL, and Tableau which are some of the skills I have that are directly involved in business.
                To be honest when watching these videos now I find them cringey. I started working as client relations for a company shortly after where I gave trainings all the time.
                Since the making of those videos my ability to teach, demonstrate, and just communicate in general have increased ten fold. 
                Then of course each of the demonstrated skills have improved dramatically as well, but I haven't dedicated the time to remaking them.
                They will still serve their purpose of demonstrating how quickly I can learn new skills though as I was sure to mention how many days or hours of studying had been required to learn the demonstrated skills.
                Lastly if you scroll down there is a summary and explanation of my work ethic and values. It's written in a serious and professional tone so I do hope you enjoy that.
            </p>

            <p>Growing up, my dad worked for the railroad and served in the military. He was a hard worker and an excellent provider who set a great example for me. 
                I learned to do a good job not because I’m getting paid but because the quality of one’s work is a reflection on not just oneself but also one’s family. 
                A man with a poor work ethic is a poor man indeed.
            </p>
            <p>
                While I am proud to carry on the work ethic my family is known for, I am not interested in sacrificing my health to do so. 
                My family has a history of working themselves to death. My father still works a very physically demanding job with three bulged disks in his back. 
                Whether it be from pain or because he is working the night shift, he doesn’t have time to be with his family like he should.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I worked my twelve-hour night shift at the factory, I realized that if I didn’t make a change, I would end up repeating my father’s mistakes.
                It’s this desire to provide a better home life for my family that has led me to acquire the skills to work as a data analyst. 
                These are the things that drive me to achieve.
